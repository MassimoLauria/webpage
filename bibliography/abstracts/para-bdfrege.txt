<p>  A  general  framework  for  parameterized  proof  complexity  was
introduced  by Dantchev, Martin,  and Szeider  [FOCS, 2007].   In that
framework  the  parameterized  version  of  any proof  system  is  not
fpt-bounded  for  some technical  reasons,  but  we  remark that  this
question  becomes much more  interesting if  we restrict  ourselves to
those parameterized  contradictions $(F,k)$ in  which $F$ itself  is a
contradiction.     We   call    such    parameterized   contradictions
<i>strong</i>,  and with  one important  exception (vertex  cover) all
interesting  contradictions we are  aware of  are strong.   It follows
from the gap complexity theorem of Dantchev, Martin and Szeider [FOCS,
2007]  that  tree-like  Parameterized  Resolution is  not  fpt-bounded
w.r.t. strong parameterized contradictions.  </p>

<p>
The  main result  of this  paper significantly  improves upon  this by
showing that even the  parameterized version of bounded-depth Frege is
not  fpt-bounded  w.r.t. strong  contradictions.  More precisely,  we
prove  that   the  pigeonhole   principle  requires  proofs   of  size
$n^{\Omega(k)}$  in bounded-depth Frege,  and, as  a special  case, in
dag-like  Parameterized  Resolution.  This  answers  an open  question
posed in Dantchev, Martin and Szeider [FOCS, 2007].
</p>

<p>   In   the  opposite   direction,   we   interpret  a   well-known
$\mathsf{FPT}$  algorithm for  vertex cover  as a  DPLL  procedure for
Parameterized Resolution.  Its generalization leads to  a proof search
algorithm for  Parameterized Resolution that in  particular shows that
tree-like  Parameterized Resolution  allows short  refutations  of all
parameterized contradictions given as bounded-width CNF's.</p>

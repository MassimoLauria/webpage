We  study   the  performance  of  DPLL   algorithms  on  parameterized
problems. In particular, we investigate  how difficult it is to decide
whether  small solutions  exist for  satisfiability  and combinatorial
problems.

For this  purpose we  develop a Prover-Delayer  game which  models the
running   time    of   DPLL    procedures   and   we    establish   an
information-theoretic  method to  obtain lower  bounds to  the running
time of parameterized DPLL procedures.


We  illustrate   this  technique  by  showing  lower   bounds  to  the
parameterized pigeonhole principle and to the ordering principle.

As our main application we study the DPLL procedure for the problem of
deciding whether a graph has a small clique.  We show that proving the
absence  of  a  $k$-clique   requires  $n^{\Omega(k)}$  steps  for  a
non-trivial distribution of graphs close to the critical threshold.

For the  restricted case  of tree-like Parameterized  Resolution, this
result  answers a  question  asked  in Beyersdorff  et  al. (2012)  of
understanding the Resolution complexity of this family of formulas.

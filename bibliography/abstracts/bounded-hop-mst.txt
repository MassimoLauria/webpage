The $d$-Dim $h$-hops MST problem is defined as follows: Given a set $S$ of points in the $d$-
dimensional Euclidean space and $s \in S$, find a minimum-cost spanning tree for $S$ rooted at $s$
with height at most $h$. We investigate the problem for any constants $h$ and $d > 0$. We prove
the first non trivial lower bound on the solution cost <em>for almost all</em> Euclidean instances (i.e.
the lower-bound holds with hight probability). Then we introduce an easy-to-implement,
very fast divide et impera heuristic and we prove that its solution cost matches the lower
bound.

<p>We study  the proof  complexity of Paris-Harrington’s  Large Ramsey
Theorem  for  bi-colorings  of  graphs and  of  off-diagonal  Ramsey’s
Theorem. For Paris-Harrington we prove a non-trivial conditional lower
bound in  Resolution and  a non-trivial  upper bound  in bounded-depth
Frege. The lower bound is  conditional on a (very reasonable) hardness
assumption  for  a  weak (quasi-polynomial)  Pigeonhole  principle  in
$\mathsf{Res}(2)$. We  show that  under such  assumption, there  is no
refutation of  the Paris-Harrington formulas of  size quasi-polynomial
in the number of propositional  variables. The proof technique for the
lower bound  extends the  idea of using  a combinatorial  principle to
blow-up a  counterexample for  another combinatorial  principle beyond
the  threshold  of  inconsistency.  A   strong  link  with  the  proof
complexity  of   an  unbalanced   off-diagonal  Ramsey   principle  is
established. This  is obtained by  adapting some constructions  due to
Erdös and  Mills. We  prove a non-trivial  Resolution lower  bound for
a family of such off-diagonal Ramsey principles.</p>

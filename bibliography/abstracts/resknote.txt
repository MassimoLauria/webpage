<p>
In this note we show two results about $k$-DNF resolution.

First we prove that resolution extended with parities of size $k$
is strictly weaker than $k$-DNF resolution.

Then we show  the connection between tree-like  $k$-DNF resolution and
narrow dag-like resolution. This latter  result is clearly implicit in
[Kraj√≠cek 1994]  but this  direct proof is  focused on  resolution and
provides information about refutation width. </p>

We show  the close  connection between the  enumeration of  cliques in
a $k$-clique  free graph  $G$ and the  length of  tree-like resolution
refutations for formula $\mathrm{Clique}(G,k)$, which claims that
$G$ has a $k$-clique.

The  length  of any  such  tree-like  refutation  is within  a  "fixed
parameter tractable" factor from the number of cliques in the graph.

We then proceed to drastically simplify the proofs of the lower bounds
for   the    length   of    tree-like   resolution    refutations   of
$\mathrm{Clique}(G,k)$ shown in [Beyersdorff  et at. 2013, Lauria
et al. 2017], which  now reduce to a simple estimate  of the number of
cliques. </p>

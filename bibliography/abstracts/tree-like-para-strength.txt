We examine the proof-theoretic strength of parameterized tree-like
resolution â€” a proof system for the $\mathsf{co}\mathsf{W}[2]$-complete set of
parameterized tautologies.  Parameterized resolution and, moreover, a general
framework for parameterized proof complexity was introduced by Dantchev, Martin,
and Szeider (FOCS'07). In that paper, Dantchev et al. show a complexity gap in
parameterized tree-like resolution for propositional formulas arising from
translations of first-order principles.

Here we pursue a purely combinatorial approach to obtain lower bounds to the
proof size in parameterized tree-like resolution.  For this we devise a
prover-delayer game suitable for parameterized resolution.  By exhibiting good
delayer strategies we then show lower bounds for the pigeonhole principle as
well as the order principle.  On the other hand, we demonstrate that
parameterized tree-like resolution is a very powerful system, as it allows
short refutations of all parameterized contradictions given as bounded-width
CNF's.  Thus, a number of principles such as Tseitin tautologies, pebbling
contradictions, or random 3-CNF's which serve as hard examples for classical
resolution become easy in the parameterized setting.

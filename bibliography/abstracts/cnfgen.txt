We present CNFgen,  a generator of combinatorial  benchmarks in DIMACS
and OPB format.  The proof complexity literature is a  rich source not
only of  hard instances but  also of instances that  are theoretically
easy  but “extremal”  in different  ways, and  therefore of  potential
interest in the  context of SAT solving. Since most  of these formulas
appear not  to be very  well known in  the SAT community,  however, we
propose CNFgen as a resource to make them readily available for solver
development and evaluation. Many  formulas studied in proof complexity
are based on graphs, and CNFgen is also able to generate, parse and do
basic manipulation of such objects. Furthermore, it includes a library
cnfformula   giving  access   to  the   functionality  of   CNFgen  to
Python programs.

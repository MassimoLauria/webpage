During the last decade, an active line of research in proof complexity
has  been to  study  space complexity  and  time-space trade-offs  for
proofs.   Besides  being a  natural  complexity  measure of  intrinsic
interest,  space is also  an important  issue in  SAT solving,  and so
research  has mostly  focused on  weak systems  that are  used  by SAT
solvers.
</p>

<p> There  has been a relatively  long sequence of papers  on space in
resolution and resolution-based proof systems, and it is probably fair
to say that  resolution is reasonably well understood  from this point
of  view. For  other natural  candidates  to study,  however, such  as
polynomial calculus or cutting planes,  very little has been known. We
are not aware of any nontrivial space lower bounds for cutting planes,
and  for polynomial calculus  the only  lower bound  has been  for CNF
formulas of unbounded width in [Alekhnovich et al.'02], where the
space lower bound is smaller than  the initial width of the clauses in
the  formulas.   Thus, in  particular,  it  has  been consistent  with
current knowledge that polynomial calculus could be able to refute any
$k$-CNF formula in constant space.</p>

<p> In this paper, we prove several new results on space in polynomial
calculus (PC),  and in the  extended proof system  polynomial calculus
resolution (PCR) studied in [Alekhnovich et al.'02]:
<ol>
<li>We prove an $\Omega(n)$ space lower bound in PC
    for the canonical $3$-CNF version of the pigeonhole principle
    formulas $\mathsf{PHP}_n^m$ with $m$ pigeons and $n$ holes, and show
    that this is tight.</li>
<li>
For PCR, we prove an $\Omega(n)$ space lower bound for a bitwise
    encoding of the functional pigeonhole principle with
    $m$ pigeons and $n$ holes. These formulas have
    width $O(\log n)$, and so this is an exponential improvement
    over [Alekhnovich et al.'02] measured in the width of the formulas.</li>
<li>
    We then present another encoding of a version of the
    pigeonhole principle that has constant width, and prove
    an $\Omega(n)$ space lower bound in PCR for these formulas as well.</li>

<li>
    Finally, we prove that any $k$-CNF formula can be refuted in PC in
    simultaneous exponential size and linear space (which holds for
    resolution and thus for PCR, but was not obviously the case for
    PC). We also characterize a natural class of CNF formulas for
    which the space complexity in resolution and PCR does not change
    when the formula is transformed into a $3$-CNF in the canonical way,
    something that we believe can be useful when proving PCR space lower
    bounds for other well-studied formula families in proof complexity.

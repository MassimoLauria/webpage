    Cutting planes proofs for integer programs can  naturally be
    defined both in a syntactic and in a semantic fashion. Filmus et
    al. (STACS 2016) proved that semantic cutting planes proofs may be
    exponentially stronger than syntactic ones, even if they use the
    semantic rule only once.

We show that when semantic cutting planes proofs are restricted to
    have coefficients bounded by
    a function growing slowly enough,
    syntactic cutting planes can simulate them efficiently.

Furthermore if we strengthen the restriction to a constant bound,
    then the simulating syntactic proof even has polynomially small
    coefficients.

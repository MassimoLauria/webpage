We prove that Polynomial Calculus and Polynomial Calculus with Resolution are
not automatizable, unless $W[P]$-hard problems are fixed parameter tractable by
one-side error randomized algorithms. This extends to Polynomial Calculus the
analogous result obtained for Resolution by Alekhnovich and Razborov (SIAM
J. Computing, 38(4), 2008).

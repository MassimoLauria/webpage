Vanishing  sums of  roots  of  unity can  be  seen  as a  natural
  generalization  of  knapsack  from Boolean  variables  to  variables
  taking values over  the roots of unity. We show  that these sums are
  hard to prove  for polynomial calculus and  for sum-of-squares, both
  in terms of degree and size. </p>

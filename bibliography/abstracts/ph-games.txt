We give upper  bounds for a positional  game — in the sense  of Beck —
based on the  Paris—Harrington Theorem for bi-colorings  of graphs and
uniform  hypergraphs  of  arbitrary  dimension.  The  bounds  for  the
positional game show a striking difference when compared to the bounds
for   the  combinatorial   principle  itself.   Our  results   confirm
a phenomenon already observed by Beck and others: the upper bounds for
the game version of a  combinatorial principle are drastically smaller
than  the upper  bounds  for  the principle  itself.  In  the case  of
Paris-Harrington games the difference  is qualitatively very striking.
For example,  the bounds for  the game on $3$-uniform  hypergraphs are
a fixed stack  of exponentials while the bounds  for the corresponding
combinatorial  principle  are  known  to  be  at  least  Ackermannian.
For higher dimensions, the  combinatorial Paris-Harrington numbers are
known  to   be  cofinal  in  the   Schwichtenberg-Wainer  Hiearchy  of
fast-growing  functions up  to the  ordinal $\varepsilon_0$,  while we
show  that the  game  Paris-Harrington numbers  are  bounded by  fixed
stacks of exponentials.

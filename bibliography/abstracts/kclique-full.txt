  We prove that for $k \ll \sqrt[4]{n}$ regular resolution requires
  length $n^{\Omega(k)}$ to establish that
  an Erdős-Rényi graph with appropriately chosen edge density
  does not contain a $k$-clique. This lower bound is optimal up to the
  multiplicative constant in the exponent, and  also implies
  unconditional $n^{\Omega(k)}$ lower bounds on running time for
  several state-of-the-art algorithms for finding maximum cliques in
  graphs.

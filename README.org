#+TITLE: Massimo Lauria @ Sapienza - the webpage

This is  the source code  for the  my webpage, currently  published at
[[http://www.massimolauria.net/]]

The source does not contain:
    - the individual course pages,  they have separate (maybe private)
      repositories;
    - the blog.

The idea  is that the site  is a bunch of  =org-mode= files, converted
into  a proper  webpage with  some  =org-publish= magic.  The site  is
uploaded using =rsync=.

We consider the natural encoding of the $k$-colouring problem for a
   given graph as a set of polynomial equations.
  We prove that there are bounded-degree graphs that do not have legal
  $k$-colourings but for which the polynomial calculus proof system
  defined in [Clegg et al '96, Alekhnovich et al '02]
  requires linear degree, and hence exponential size, to establish
  this fact. This implies a linear degree lower bound for any algorithms based
  on Gröbner bases solving $k$-colouring problems using this encoding.
  The same bound applies also for the algorithm studied in a sequence of papers
  [De Loera et al '08, '09, '11, '15]
  based on Hilbert's Nullstellensatz proofs for a slightly
  different encoding, thus resolving an open problem  mentioned, e.g., in  
  [De Loera et al '09] and [Li et al '16].
  <br />
  We obtain  our results by  combining the polynomial  calculus degree
  lower bound for functional pigeonhole principle (FPHP) formulas over
  bounded-degree bipartite graphs in [Mikša and Nordström '15]
  with a reduction from FPHP  to $k$-colouring derivable by polynomial
  calculus in constant degree.

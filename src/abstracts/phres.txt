We initiate the study of the proof complexity of propositional encoding of (weak
cases of) concrete independence results. In particular we study the proof
complexity of Paris-Harrington's Large Ramsey Theorem. We prove a conditional
lower bound in Resolution and a quasipolynomial upper bound in bounded-depth
Frege.

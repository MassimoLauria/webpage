<p>We  initiate the  study of  the proof  complexity  of propositional
encoding of  (weak cases of) concrete independence  results.  We study
the proof  complexity of  Paris-Harrington's Large Ramsey  Theorem for
bicolorings of graphs.</p>

<p>We prove a non-trivial conditional  lower bound in Resolution and a
quasi-polynomial upper bound in  bounded-depth Frege.  The lower bound
is conditional on a  hardness assumption for a Weak (quasi-polynomial)
Pigeonhole Principle in $\mathsf{Res}(2)$.  The proof technique of the
lower bound  extends the  idea of using  a combinatorial  principle to
blow-up  a counterexample for  another combinatorial  principle beyond
the  threshold  of  inconsistency.   A  strong  link  with  the  proof
complexity  of  an  unbalanced   Ramsey  principle  for  triangles  is
established.   This is  obtained by  applying some  highly non-trivial
constructions due to Erd√∂s and Mills.</p>

Given a propositional formula $\phi$ we are interested in studying how difficult
is to prove that $\phi$ is a tautology. Multivariate polynomials can be
manipulated in a specific way to obtain such a proof. We study the power of this
algebraic manipulation. In particular its running time is deeply related with
the degree of the polynomials involved. We prove that this method behaves very
badly in some cases, by showing that there are tautologies with very short
proofs but which require high degree polynomials.

This does not exclude that another method of polynomial manipulation could lead
to an efficient algorithm. In this case we are able to prove that if such
efficient algorithm exists, it could be used to solve problems believed to be
very hard.

Algebraic proof systems discussed so far are limited. We define a slightly
stronger system $\mathsf{Pcr}_{k}$. We give examples of tautologies that are easy for this
system, but very hard for systems known in literature. Nevertheless we show that
a random tautology is still very hard to prove for $\mathsf{Pcr}_{k}$.

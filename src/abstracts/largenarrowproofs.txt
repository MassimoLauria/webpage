We prove that there are  $3$-CNF formulas over $n$ variables refutable
in  resolution in  width $w$  that require  resolution proofs  of size
$n^{\Omega(w)}$.  This shows that the simple counting argument that
any  formula  refutable  in  width  $w$ must  have  a  proof  in  size
$n^{O(w)}$  is  essentially  tight.  Moreover,  our  lower  bound
extends   even   to   polynomial   calculus   resolution   (PCR)   and
Sherali-Adams, implying  that the  corresponding size upper  bounds in
terms of degree and rank are tight as well.  In contrast, the formulas
have Lasserre proofs of constant rank  and size polynomial in both $n$
and $w$.

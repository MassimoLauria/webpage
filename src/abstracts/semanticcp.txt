  In this paper, we compare the strength of the semantic and syntactic
  version of the <em>cutting planes</em> proof system.
  <br />
  First, we show that the lower bound technique of Pudlak applies also
  to  semantic   cutting  planes:   the  proof  system   has  feasible
  interpolation via monotone real circuits, which gives an exponential
  lower bound on lengths of semantic cutting planes refutations.
  <br />
  Second,  we  show  that   semantic  refutations  are  stronger  than
  syntactic  ones. In  particular, we  give  a formula  for which  any
  refutation in syntactic cutting  planes requires exponential length,
  while there  is a polynomial  length refutation in  semantic cutting
  planes. In other words, syntactic cutting planes does not p-simulate
  semantic  cutting  planes. We  also  give  two incompatible  integer
  inequalities   which  require   exponential  length   refutation  in
  syntactic cutting planes.
  <br />
  Finally, we pose the following problem, which arises in connection with
  semantic inference of arity larger than two: can every multivariate
  non-decreasing real function be expressed as a composition of
  non-decreasing real functions in two variables?

  During the last decade, an active line of research in proof
  complexity has been into the space complexity of proofs and how
  space is related to other measures. By now these aspects of
  resolution are fairly well understood, but many open problems remain
  for the related but stronger polynomial calculus (PC/PCR) proof
  system.  For instance, the space complexity of many standard
  “benchmark formulas” is still open, as well as the relation of
  space to size and degree in PC/PCR.
  <br />
  We prove that if a formula requires large resolution width, then
  making XOR substitution yields a formula requiring large PCR space,
  providing some circumstantial evidence that degree might be a lower
  bound for space. More importantly, this immediately yields formulas
  that are very hard for space but very easy for size, exhibiting a
  size-space separation similar to what is known for resolution. Using
  related ideas, we show that if a graph has good expansion and in
  addition its edge set can be partitioned into short cycles, then the
  Tseitin formula over this graph requires large PCR space. In
  particular, Tseitin formulas over random $4$-regular graphs
  almost surely require space at least $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$.
  <br />
  Our proofs use techniques recently introduced in
  [Bonacina-Galesi '13].  Our final contribution, however, is to show
  that these techniques provably cannot yield non-constant space lower
  bounds for the functional pigeonhole principle, delineating the
  limitations of this framework and suggesting that we are still far
  from characterizing PC/PCR space.

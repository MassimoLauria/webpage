In  this note  we show  that any  $k$-CNF which  can be  refuted  by a
quasi-polynomial $\mathsf{Res}^{*}(\mathsf{polylog})$ refutation has a
“narrow”  refutation  in  $\mathsf{Res}$  (i.e.,  of  poly-logarithmic
width).  Notice  that while $\mathsf{Res}^{*}(\mathsf{polylog})$  is a
complete proof system,  this is not the case  for $\mathsf{Res}$ if we
ask for  a narrow refutation.  In  particular is not  even possible to
express all CNFs with narrow clauses.  But even for constant width CNF
the former system  is complete and the latter is  not (see for example
Bonet, Galesi  2001).  We  are going to  show that the  formulas “left
out”       are      the       ones      which       require      large
$\mathsf{Res}^{*}(\mathsf{polylog})$  refutations.  We  also  show the
converse implication:  a narrow Resolution refutation can be simulated
by a short $\mathsf{Res}^{*}(\mathsf{polylog})$ refutation.

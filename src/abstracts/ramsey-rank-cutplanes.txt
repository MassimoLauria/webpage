Ramsey's Theorem is  a cornerstone of combinatorics and  logic. In its
simplest formulation it says that for every $k > 0$ and $s > 0$, there
is a minimum number  $r(k, s)$ such that any simple  graph with at least
$r(k, s)$ vertices contains either a  clique of size $k$ or an independent
set of size $s$. We study the complexity of proving upper bounds for the
number $r(k,  k)$. In  particular, we focus  on the  propositional proof
system cutting  planes; we show  that any  cutting plane proof  of the
upper bound “$r(k, k) \leq 4k$” requires  high rank. In order to do that we
show a protection lemma which could be of independent interest.

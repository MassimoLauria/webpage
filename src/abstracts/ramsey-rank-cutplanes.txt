Ramsey Theorem  is a  cornerstone of combinatorics  and logic.  In its
simplest formulation  it says that there  is a function  $r$ such that
any simple  graph with $r(k,s)$  vertices contains either a  clique of
size $k$ or  an independent set of size $s$.   We study the complexity
of  proving upper  bounds for  the number  $r(k,k)$. In  particular we
focus on the propositional proof  system cutting planes; we prove that
the upper  bound $r(k,k)\leq 4^{k}$ requires  cutting planes proof
of high  rank. In order  to do that  we show a protection  lemma which
could be of independent interest.

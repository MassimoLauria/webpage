  In this note we argue that semantic cutting planes refutations are
  stronger than syntactic ones. In particular, we give a formula for
  which any refutation in syntactic cutting planes requires
  exponential length, while there is a polynomial length refutation in
  semantic cutting planes. This means that syntactic cutting planes
  does not p-simulate (nor simulate) semantic cutting planes.

  We  also give  a pair  of  incompatible cutting  planes lines  which
require exponential length to be  refuted in syntactic cutting planes.

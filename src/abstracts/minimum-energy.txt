The <em>Minimum-Energy Broadcast</em> problem is to assign a transmission range to every
station of an ad hoc wireless networks so that (i) a given source station is
allowed to perform broadcast operations and (ii) the overall energy consumption
of the range assignment is minimized.

We prove a nearly tight asymptotical bound on the optimal cost for the
Minimum-Energy Broadcast problem on square grids. We also derive near-tight
bounds for the <em>Bounded-Hop</em> version of this problem. Our results imply
that the best-known heuristic, the MST-based one, for the Minimum-Energy
Broadcast problem is far to achieve optimal solutions (even) on very regular,
well-spread instances: its worst-case approximation ratio is about $\pi$ and it
yields $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ source hops, where $n$ is the number of stations.

As a by product, we get nearly tight bounds for the <em>Minimum-Disk Cover</em>
problem and for its restriction in which the allowed disks must have
<em>non-constant</em> radius.
</p>
<p>Finally, we emphasize that our upper bounds are obtained via polynomial time constructions.</p>

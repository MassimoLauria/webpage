We  explain   an  asymmetric   Prover-Delayer  game   which  precisely
characterizes  proof  size  in  tree-like Resolution.  This  game  was
previously  described in  a parameterized  complexity context  to show
lower  bounds  for  parameterized   formulas  and  for  the  classical
pigeonhole principle. The main point of  this note is to show that the
asymmetric game in fact characterizes tree-like Resolution proof size,
i.e.  in principle  our  proof  method allows  to  always achieve  the
optimal lower  bounds. This  is in  contrast with  previous techniques
described  in  the  literature.  We  also  provide  a  very  intuitive
information-theoretic interpretation of the game.

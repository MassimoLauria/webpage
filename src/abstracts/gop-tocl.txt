<p>  There are  methods to  turn short  refutations  in <em>Polynomial
Calculus</em>   ($\mathsf{Pc}$)  and   <em>Polynomial   Calculus  with
Resolution</em> ($\mathsf{Pcr}$) into refutations of low degree. Bonet
and Galesi  [Bonet and  Galesi 1999, 2003]  asked if  such size-degree
trade-offs  for  $\mathsf{Pc}$  [Clegg  et al.  1996;  Impagliazzo  et
al. 1999]  and $\mathsf{Pcr}$ [Alekhnovich  et al. 2004]  are optimal.
</p>

<p>  We answer  this  question  by showing  a  polynomial encoding  of
<em>Graph  Ordering  Principle</em> on  $m$  variables which  requires
$\mathsf{Pc}$    and     $\mathsf{Pcr}$    refutations    of    degree
$\Omega(\sqrt{m})$. Trade-offs optimality  follows from our result and
from the short  refutations of Graph Ordering Principle  in [Bonet and
Galesi 1999, 2001].  </p>

<p> We  then introduce  the algebraic proof  system $\mathsf{Pcr}_{k}$
which  combines together <em>Polynomial  Calculus</em> ($\mathsf{Pc}$)
and <em>$k$-DNF  Resolution</em> ($\mathsf{Res}_{k}$). We  show a size
hierarchy   theorem  for  $\mathsf{Pcr}_{k}$:   $\mathsf{Pcr}_{k}$  is
exponentially separated  from $\mathsf{Pcr}_{k+1}$. This  follows from
the  previous degree  lower bound  and from  techniques  developed for
$\mathsf{Res}_{k}$.  </p>

<p>Finally  we show that  random formulas  in conjunctive  normal form
($3$-CNF) are hard to refute in $\mathsf{Pcr}_{k}$.</p>

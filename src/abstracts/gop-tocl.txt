<p> There are methods to turn short refutations in <em>Polynomial Calculus</em>
($\Pc$) and <em>Polynomial Calculus with Resolution</em> ($\Pcr$) into refutations of
low degree. Bonet and Galesi [Bonet and Galesi 1999, 2003] asked if such size-degree
trade-offs for $\Pc$ [Clegg et al. 1996; Impagliazzo et al. 1999] and $\Pcr$
[Alekhnovich et al. 2004] are optimal.
</p>


<p> We answer this question by showing a polynomial encoding of <em>Graph
Ordering Principle</em> on $m$ variables which requires $\Pc$ and $\Pcr$
refutations of degree $\Omega(\sqrt{m})$. Trade-offs optimality follows from our
result and from the short refutations of Graph Ordering Principle in [Bonet and
Galesi 1999, 2001].
</p>

<p> We then introduce the algebraic proof system $\Pcrk{k}$ which combines
together <em>Polynomial Calculus</em> ($\Pc$) and <em>$k$-DNF Resolution</em>
($\Resk{k}$). We show a size hierarchy theorem for $\Pcrk{k}$: $\Pcrk{k}$ is
exponentially separated from $\Pcrk{k+1}$. This follows from the previous degree
lower bound and from techniques developed for $\Resk{k}$.  </p>

<p>Finally we show that random formulas in conjunctive normal form ($3$-CNF) are
hard to refute in $\Pcrk{k}$.</p>

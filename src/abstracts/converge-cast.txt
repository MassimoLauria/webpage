Given a set $S$ of points (<em>stations</em>) located in the $d$-dim. Euclidean space and a
<em>root</em> $b \in S$, the $h$-$\mathsf{hops Convergecast}$ problem asks to find for a minimal
energy-cost range assignment which allows to perform the <em>converge-cast</em> primitive
(i.e. node accumulation) towards $b$ in at most $h$ hops. For this problem no
polynomial time algorithm is known even for $h = 2$.

<p> The main goal of this work is the design of an efficient <em>distributed</em>
heuristic (i.e. protocol) and the analysis (both theoretical and experimental)
of its expected solution cost. In particular, we introduce an efficient
parameterized randomized protocol for $h$-$\mathsf{hops Convergecast}$ and we analyze it on
<em>random</em> instances created by placing $n$ points uniformly at random in a $d$-cube
of side length $L$. We prove that for $h = 2$, its expected approximation ratio
is bounded by some constant factor. Finally, for $h = 3,..., 8$, we provide a
wide experimental study showing that our protocol has very good performances
when compared with previously introduced (centralized) heuristics.  </p>

We give upper bounds for a positional game — in the sense of Beck
— based on the Paris-Harrington principle for bi-colorings of graphs
and  uniform hypergraphs of  arbitrary dimension.   The bounds  show a
striking difference  with respect to  the bounds of  the combinatorial
principle itself. Our results confirm a phenomenon already observed by
Beck  and  others:  the  upper  bounds  for  the  game  version  of  a
combinatorial principle are drastically  smaller than the upper bounds
for the  principle itself. In  the case of Paris-Harrington  games the
difference is qualitatively very striking.
For example, the bounds for  the game on $3$-uniform hypergraphs are a
fixed  stack of  exponentials while  the bounds  on  the corresponding
combinatorial  principle are  known  to be  Ackermannian!  For  higher
dimensions, the combinatorial Paris-Harrington numbers are known to be
cofinal   in  the   Schwichtenberg-Wainer  Hiearchy   of  fast-growing
functions  up  to  $\varepsilon_0$,   while  we  show  that  the  game
Paris-Harrington numbers are fixed stacks of exponentials.

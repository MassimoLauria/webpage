We  exhibit  families  of  $k$-CNF  formulas  on  $n$  variables  with
sums-of-squares (SOS)  proofs of  unsatisfiability of degree  $d$ that
require  SOS  proofs of  size  $n^{\Omega(d)}$  for  $d =  d(n)$  from
constant all the way up to $n^\delta$ for some constant $\delta$. This
shows that the $n^{O(d)}$ running  time obtained by using the Lasserre
semidefinite programming relaxations to  find degree-$d$ SOS proofs is
optimal  up to  constant factors  in the  exponent. We  establish this
result  by  combining  NP-reductions  expressible  as  low-degree  SOS
derivations with  the idea of  relativizing CNF formulas  in [Dantchev
and  Riis  '03],  and  then  applying a  restriction  argument  as  in
[Atserias, Muller, and Oliva '13] and [Atserias, Lauria, and Nordstrom
'14].  This  yields a  generic method of  amplifying SOS  degree lower
bounds  to size  lower bounds  (and also  generalizes the  approach in
[ALN14] to obtain size lower  bounds for the proof systems resolution,
polynomial  calculus, and  Sherali-Adams from  lower bounds  on width,
degree, and rank, respectively).

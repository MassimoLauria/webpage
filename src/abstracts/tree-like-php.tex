In this note we show that the asymmetric Prover-Delayer game developed in
Beyersdorff, Galesi, Lauria [20010a] for Parameterized Resolution is also
applicable to other tree-like proof systems.  In particular, we use this
asymmetric Prover-Delayer game to show a lower bound of the form
$2^{\Omega(n\log n)}$ for the pigeonhole principle in tree-like Resolution.
This gives a new and simpler proof of the same lower bound established by Iwama
and Miyazaki [1999] and Dantchev and Riis [2001].

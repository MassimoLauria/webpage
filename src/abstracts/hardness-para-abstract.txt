<p> Parameterized Resolution and, moreover, a general framework for
parameterized proof complexity was introduced by Dantchev, Martin, and Szeider
(FOCS'07). In that paper, Dantchev et al. show a complexity gap in tree-like
Parameterized Resolution for propositional formulas arising from translations of
first-order principles.  </p>

<p> We broadly investigate Parameterized Resolution obtaining the following main
results: </p>

<ul>
<li>We introduce a purely combinatorial approach to obtain lower bounds to the
  proof size in tree-like Parameterized Resolution.  For this we devise a new
  asymmetric Prover-Delayer game which characterizes proofs in (parameterized)
  tree-like Resolution.  By exhibiting good Delayer strategies we then show
  lower bounds for the pigeonhole principle as well as the order principle.
</li>
<li> Interpreting a well-known $\mathsf{FPT}$ algorithm for vertex cover as a DPLL
procedure for Parameterized Resolution, we devise a proof search algorithm for
Parameterized Resolution and show that tree-like Parameterized Resolution allows
short refutations of all parameterized contradictions given as bounded-width
CNF's.
</li>
<li> We answer a question posed by Dantchev, Martin, and Szeider in [FOCS 2007],
  showing that dag-like Parameterized Resolution is not fpt-bounded. We obtain
  this result by proving that the pigeonhole principle requires proofs of size
  $n^{\Omega(k)}$ in dag-like Parameterized Resolution.  For this lower bound we
  use a different Prover-Delayer game which was developed for Resolution by
  Pudl√°k [2000].
</li>
</ul>

#+TITLE: Massimo Lauria @ Sapienza - Software

* 

  My work has mostly theoretical nature,  but from time to time it
  is  useful   to  produce   some  piece   of  software   to  help
  with research. My software can be found on [[https://github.com/MassimoLauria/][GitHub]]

* CNF formula generator [[https://github.com/MassimoLauria/cnfgen][(here)]]

  Proof complexity  research often  studies benchmark  formulas to
  prove various  theorems. Furthermore it is  often informative to
  run SAT solvers on  these formulas. <code>CNFgen</code> software
  (and the included  library) provides a convenient  way to create
  and manipulate these formulas.
  
* Pebble [[https://github.com/MassimoLauria/pebble][(here)]]
  
  This program computes  the black/reversible/black-white pebbling
  number  of  a  single  sink  directed  acyclic  graph.  This  is
  a particularly difficult computation, and the program uses a lot
  of memory and time.

    <p>
      My work has mostly theoretical nature,  but from time to time it
      is  useful   to  produce   some  piece   of  software   to  help
      with research.
      My software can be found on <a href="https://github.com/MassimoLauria/">GitHub</a>.

      <entry_title>CNF formula generator [<a href="https://github.com/MassimoLauria/cnfgen">here</a>]</entry_title>

      Proof complexity  research often  studies benchmark  formulas to
      prove various  theorems. Furthermore it is  often informative to
      run SAT solvers on  these formulas. <code>CNFgen</code> software
      (and the included  library) provides a convenient  way to create
      and manipulate these formulas.

      <entry_title>Pebble [<a href="https://github.com/MassimoLauria/pebble">here</a>]</entry_title>

      This program computes  the black/reversible/black-white pebbling
      number  of  a  single  sink  directed  acyclic  graph.  This  is
      a particularly difficult computation, and the program uses a lot
      of memory and time.
